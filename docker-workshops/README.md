Docker Workshops
================

### Docker Platform Introduction

A full-day workshop that takes the attendees from "What is Docker" to "Here's how you run a cluster of Docker hosts and schedule containers on top of them".

Currently, this lab is intended to be ran locally.

### Docker with Storage and Networking

A 3-hour workshop that focuses on the Docker platform 1.9+ including external storage and networking.  The storage section is focused on leveraging `REX-Ray`, a storage orchestration engine, with `Docker`.  The networking section is using embedded `Docker` networking through the `libNetwork` project.

Currently, this lab is ran from AWS and requires that you use `docker-machine` to deploy two machines that are configured using a custom `extension` package.
