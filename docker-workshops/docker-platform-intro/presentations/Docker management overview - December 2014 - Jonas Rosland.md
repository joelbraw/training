Different types of management

**Developer-focused:**
- Fig
- Panamax

**Ops-focused:**
- Kubernetes
- Mesos
- Fleet
- Docker Swarm

## Fig example (1/3)

Let's define two services:

**web**
- built from Dockerfile
- run the command python app.py inside the image
- forward the exposed port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on the host machine
- connect to the Redis service
- mount the current directory inside the container

**redis**, which uses the public image redis

---

## Fig example (2/3)

Dockerfile:

```
FROM python:2.7
ADD . /code
WORKDIR /code
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Fig example (3/3)

fig.yml:

```
web:
  build: .
  command: python app.py
  ports:
   - "5000:5000"
  volumes:
   - .:/code
  links:
   - redis
redis:
  image: redis
```
---

## Docker Compose is Fig Next Gen

```
containers:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python app.py
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
    - .:/code
    links:
    - redis
    environment:
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
```

# Panamax

## Panamax

An open-source project that makes deploying complex containerized apps as easy as Drag-and-Drop
Created by CenturyLink Labs
Released in August 2014

# Kubernetes

---

## Kubernetes

An open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts

Providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications

---

## Kubernetes main features

- lean: lightweight, simple, accessible
- portable: public, private, hybrid, multi cloud
- extensible: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
- self-healing: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication

---

## Kubernetes concepts (1/2)

**Clusters** are the compute resources on top of which your containers are built

**Pods** are a colocated group of Docker containers with shared volumes - smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed with Kubernetes

---

## Kubernetes concepts (2/2)

**Replication** controllers manage the lifecycle of pods, ensuring that a specified number of pods are running at any given time, by creating or killing pods as required

**Services** provide a single, stable name and address for a set of pods, acting as basic load balancers

**Labels** are used to organize and select groups of objects based on key:value pairs

## Kubernetes pod example

```
{
  "id": "redis-master",
  "kind": "Pod",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "desiredState": {
    "manifest": {
      "version": "v1beta1",
      "id": "redis-master",
      "containers": [{
        "name": "master",
        "image": "dockerfile/redis",
        "cpu": 100,
        "ports": [{
          "containerPort": 6379,
          "hostPort": 6379
        }]
      }]
    }
  },
  "labels": {
    "name": "redis-master"
  }
}
```

# Mesos

---

## Mesos

Abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual)

Enables fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively

![inline](http://mesos.apache.org/assets/img/mesos_logo.png)

---

## Mesos functionality

The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments

Also manages containers, of course

All using one API to provision and manage everything

---

## More on Mesos

I highly recommend reading up on Mesosphere
