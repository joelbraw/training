## systemd

System management daemon
Services, timers and one-off jobs
Logging through journal

---

## etcd

Highly available Key-Value database store
Provides service discovery and shared configurations
Others like it are Consul and Zookeeper
Provides a locking mechanism for safe(r) automatic updates

Public etcd service:
```
https://discovery.etcd.io/
```
This is frickin awesome, as you'll see :)

---

## etcdctl command

```
$ set services/db1 10.0.0.101
$ set services/db2 10.0.0.102
$ set services/db-master db1
```

```
$ get services/db-master
  "db1"
$ get services/db1
  "10.0.0.101"
```

## Putting it all together

1. Create a systemd file for your service
2. Start the service using fleet
3. Register services in etcd
4. ...
5. Profit!
